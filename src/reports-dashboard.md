# Reports: Dashboard

_Part of Presentation Management is reporting: tracking what works and what can be improved._

## Why use the dashboard?

The dashboard is your first stop in reporting. It gives you an overview of how users are working with your Presentation Management assets in Shufflrr.

## Steps

Click the "Reports" tab then "Dashboard." Here you can see site-level data for your whole enterprise on Shufflrr, including for example,  
* Total file size, total number of files, total number of slides, shares, and users
* Total daily visitors, views, and downloads
* The change in the last thirty days in the number of files, slides, and shares
* Who in the system is creating the largest number of presentations and using the largest number of slides
* Which of your enterprise slides are most popular (most often used) among your users
* Which files are most downloaded
