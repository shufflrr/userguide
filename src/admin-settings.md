# Settings

## Why use settings? 

The settings tab allows the administrator to customize the company's Shufflrr site so that users get a corporate-branded experience with all of Shufflrr's capabilities configured to create exactly the site configuration that is appropriate for your needs. 

## Steps

There are quite a few sections to the settings tab. Click the "Admin" icon and the "Settings" tab to begin exploring.

### Your company in Shufflrr

To set up your Shufflrr site to reflect your company's branding, set up the site with your company's logo and "favicon" (the little icon that appears in the browser tab for the site).
