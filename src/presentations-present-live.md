> Be sure your camera and microphone are enabled when you go to present! A trial run with a colleague is always a good idea.   

Anyone clicking this link will be brought directly into the presentation "room" with your face on camera - even better than a Zoom screenshare. 

While you are presenting, anyone with the link can enter the presentation "room."

If in the middle of presenting, someone asks a question about content you have not included in the deck, you can click the "files" tab and use search or navigation to find exactly what you need for the moment.

* During the presentation, people can discuss the presentation aloud, as well as entering comments in the session chat. 
* Anyone with the link can attend, but to post a comment, people must log in. This gives you a record of who commented what during what slide being displayed.
