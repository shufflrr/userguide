# Present Live

## Why use PresentLive? 

* Present to anyone anytime - better than Zoom.
* Everyone see each other and the presentation, and presentations can be recorded. 
* Plus, you will have reporting data on: 
	* who was in attendance when
	* what slides they saw
	* what their comments were
	
## Steps

* To present a deck, first click the "play" button. 
    * You can find this in the top right of the main area of the presentations screen. 
    * Or, you can click the down arrow next to the filename in the left navigation 
* Then click the "PresentLive" button that appears at the bottom of the screen and enter the email of anyone you want to share the presentation with. Be sure your camera and microphone are enabled!  
* Anyone clicking this link will be brought directly into the presentation "room" with your face on camera - even better than a Zoom screenshare. 
* While you are presenting, anyone with the link can enter the presentation "room."
* To post a comment, people must log in. This gives you a record of who commented what during what slide being displayed.
