# Search 

## Why search?

Search is key to shuffling slides into new decks and using them on the fly - Presentation Management at its best. Use search to

* Find slides to add to a presentation.
* Find a presentation for editing. 
* Find a slide that isn't in your pre-made deck during a PresentLive session. 

## Steps 
Type a search term in the box at top left.

You'll get every document with that term in: 
* Document title
* Text 
* Speaker notes
* Tags

Press "return" to see individual slides. This actually flips you into the advanced search.
