# Uploading

## Why upload material? 

* Maintain a central library of all your corporate slides. 
* Maintain centralized branding, messaging, accuracy, oversight, confidentiality, compliance. 
* Use existing material to make new decks without duplication of effort. 
* Uploading, organizing, and publishing enterprise assets are the key components of Presentation Management!

## Steps

Once your folder structure is created, you can begin uploading the central library decks.
* The better your content, the better your results! [Check here](start-onboarding.md#gettingcontent) for some tips on gathering great content for the slide library. 
* You can upload decks in different ways from different places
	* From the home page, select the folder in the dropdown, then use one of the options to upload folders or individual files.

* When the first process is finished, you will be able to see the deck in the left navigation and click on it. 
* You will be able to move or delete slides at this point, but not edit slides until the second process has finished. 
* When slides are ready, a blue "Edit" button will appear. Click it to modify the slides.
