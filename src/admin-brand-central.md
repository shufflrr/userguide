# Brand Central

## Why use Brand Central? 

When users create new content in Shufflrr, you want them to maintain your corporate identity by using corporate colors and fonts. Set these in "Brand Central" to ensure consistency and compliance. From this tab, you can also update the email templates that users receive. 

## Steps

Click the "Admin" icon and the "Brand Central" tab. The first three tabs are essentially empty when first opened.

#### Colors

If you uncheck the box for all colors, you get 141 pre-set colors. Click "remove preset colors" to remove them so you can add your corporate branding.

#### Fonts

To select ***system fonts*** (such as Arial, Tahoma, Trebuchet, etc.) as your corporate fonts, just click "System Fonts," then unclick any fonts you do not wish users to incorporate in their presentations.

To ***upload your own fonts***, use a true type font (.ttf) file. 

For example, to use a google font, go to the page for that font and click "download font family."

Double click on the .zip that downloads to extract it. Make sure you know where it is - you will need it in a minute!

Then, in Shufflrr, click "Add Font"...
