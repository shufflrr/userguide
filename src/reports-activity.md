# Reports: Activity

## Why use the "Activity" report? 
Part of Presentation Management is reporting: tracking what works and what can be improved. 

The activity report can tell you about: 
* Volume of different activities (are users sharing files? making files? presenting to an audience?)
* Users performing specific activities (who is doing what most often?)
