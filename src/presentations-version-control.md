# Accepting/rejecting parent changes

_Version Control (accepting/rejecting parent changes in child decks) is key to Presentation Management!_

## Why accept changes? 

* Keep up with parent slide updates
* Maintain consistency with corporate changes such as 
	* Product information
	* Compliance text
	* Branding and styling 

## Why reject changes? 

* You may want to manually make updates to branding, if, for example, font changes cause  issues with text fitting on the slide. 
* The parent updates might not be relevant to you. 
* Parent updates might have been made in error. 

## Steps

* If the parent of one of your decks has been edited, an orange circle with an exclamation point will appear next to the name of the deck.
* Click on the name to review and accept or reject the parent changes.

* You can also accept all or reject all at the top right.
