# Builders

## Why use Builders? 

Builders are used when you want to *pre-define* a deck. 
* Allow only a few customizable fields
* Disallow other editing

You can also use builders to link sets of slides together to be incorporated into child decks as a unit - for example, product slides and their disclaimer text.
