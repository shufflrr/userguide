## Building a central slide library
The better your content, the better your results! Here are some tips for creating a great slide library. 

1. **Delegate the task.**
* When creating a central slide library, it's useful to have some organization and coordination.  
* Many companies find it's helpful to have a designated person or task force overseeing the job.  
2. **Organize the folders for the content _before_ it comes in.**
* The goal is a wide array of content to be used throughout the organization.
* But it has to be organized and easy to find! 
* We suggest organizing folders the way your departments are organized: by product, by type of service, by region, etc. This helps make sure a department has access to what is relevant to that department.  
	* [Set up folders](presentations-folders.md)
* Include permissions on folders to make things easier to find, as well as to restrict access*

3. **Ways to get slides and decks for the library:**
* Have designers create templates with the company branding. 
	* [Set up templates]()
* Task your SMEs with using the templates to create slides relevant to their expertise. They can repurpose their best existing decks! 
	* [Create a new deck from a template]()
* Note: If you don't want to create design templates, you can just ask SMEs for their existing decks; you'll get content faster, but you won't be able to unify or update branding the same way.
