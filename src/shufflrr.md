# Getting started

Getting started in Shufflrr is a three-step process: 

### 1. Upload

Read more about uploading content [here](presentations-uploading.md).

### 2. Organize

You can use [folder creation](presentations-folders.md) and [permissions](presentations-permissions.md) to organize prior to uploading content. After uploading, use [search](shufflrr-search.md) to find the content you want, eliminiate duplicates, and [create new presentations](presentations-building.md) that feature the best of your existing content. 

### 3. Publish

Now, you can use [PresentLiveâ„¢](presentations-present-live.md) to present your decks, better than Zoom. Track who attends, what they see, and what they say. And, on the fly, search and present additional content so that the "presentation follows the conversation."

Use [reporting](reports.md) functions to see how you're doing, and how your best sales people do their job!
