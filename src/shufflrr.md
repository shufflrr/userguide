## 1. Upload

A good way to begin your corporate story is with your most recent 25 presentations.
Why 25 files?  We like to start with 25 files because it is a good, manageable number to start with. Furthermore, the most recent presentations usually have the latest and greatest imagery, branding and messaging. So, itâ€™s a good place to start. 

Collect your best:
* videos
* images and logos
* PDFs 
* case studies

Click the "Upload" icon in the top navigation to upload files and folders into Shufflrr. 

![Uploading](img/shufflrr-upload.png)

<a name="fileprocessing"></a>

File processing takes a few minutes when a file is added or saved. Here's how to track that: 
* You will see arrows going in a circle at the top right of the screen with a little number showing the number of files being processed.
    
![Uploading queue icon](img/presentations-upload-queueicon.png)

* Click that icon to see the status of your files. 
* Each file goes through two processes: the initial upload and the animation/editing preparation. Those will show on separate lines. 

![Uploading queue tray](img/presentations-upload-queuetray.png)    
    
* When the first process is finished, you will be able to see the deck in the left navigation and click on it. 
* You will be able to move or delete slides at this point, but not edit slides until the second process has finished. 
* When slides are ready, a blue "Edit" button will appear. Click it to modify the slides.  

![Multi-step process](img/presentations-upload-multistep.png)

> **Pro tip:** 
>
> Accidentally put the folder or file in the wrong place? Click the down arrow next to the file or folder name for the option to move it. Select the new parent folder. 

## 2. Organize

Create a folder structure that works best for your corporate story.
 
Your corporate story is like book, made up of chapters, stories and scenes. 
In Shufflrr,
* Every folder is a chapter
* Every presentation is a story
* Every slide is a scene

To create a folder, click the little down-arrow on the right side of the parent folder name. "Create Folder" is one of the options. The new folder will be inside this one.  

![How to make a folder](img/upload-makefolder.png) 

Pick your best materials and move them into the corresponding folders for your corporate story.

For example:  
* _Company History.pptx_ would go into the "Corporate Story" folder
* _Pricing.pdf_ goes into the "Product" folder
* _Logo.png_ goes into the "Marketing" folder

### Branding

Now that your content is uploaded and sorted into folders, set the corporate brand identity before going further. This can be done by an administrator in "Brand Central."

Click the "Admin" icon and the "Brand Central" tab. The first three tabs are essentially empty when first opened. 

![Unpopulated Brand Central tabs](img/admin-brand-central-empty.png)

#### Colors

If you uncheck the box for all colors, you get 141 pre-set colors. Click "remove preset colors" to remove them so you can add your corporate branding.

![Remove preset colors](img/admin-brandcentral-colors-1.png)

There are **FOUR** options for entering new colors. Zero in on the color you want and click "Add."

![Four options for adding colors](img/admin-brandcentral-colors-2.png)

Once you have your brand colors entered, they will appear to the right. 

![Corporate colors defined](img/admin-brandcentral-colors-3.png)


#### Fonts

To select ***system fonts*** (such as Arial, Tahoma, Trebuchet, etc.) as your corporate fonts, just click "System Fonts," then unclick any fonts you do not wish users to incorporate in their presentations. 

![Selecting system fonts for branding](img/admin-brandcentral-fonts-1.png)

To ***upload your own fonts***, use a true type font (.ttf) file. 

For example, to use a google font, go to the page for that font and click "download font family." 

![Downloading a google font](img/admin-brandcentral-fonts-google.png)

Double click on the .zip that downloads to extract it. Make sure you know where it is - you will need it in a minute!

Then, in Shufflrr, click "Add Font"...

![Adding a font](img/admin-brandcentral-fonts-2.png)

Select the .ttf file from inside the folder that you extracted from the Google download.

![Adding a font - selecting from your drive](img/admin-brandcentral-fonts-3.png)

Last step - IMPORTANT! Check the box to make this font available. 

![Check the box to make the font available](img/admin-brandcentral-fonts-4.png) 






The last tab contains 20 email templates. You can modify the text and/or styling according to your wishes. 

![Email templates tab](img/admin-brand-central-email.png)





### Creating

Next, you can select slides from your old content, and shuffle them into new chapters that can be used and/or customized by your team to tell your corporate story.

Your **slide tray** at the bottom of your screen keeps track of what you are building. 

![Slide tray](img/shufflrr-slide-tray.png)

Open presentations you know have slides you need, and drag & drop them into your slide tray. 

![Add slides from another presentation](img/presentations-dragslides.png)

<a name="search"></a>
> **Pro Tip!**
> 
> You can also use search to find what you want to include. 

### Searching

* Type a search term in the box at top left. 

![search](img/search-search.png)

* You'll get every document with that term in: 
	* Document title
	* Document content 
	* Speaker notes

![search sample](img/search-searchsample.png)

* Press "return" to see individual slides. 

![Press return to see individual slides](img/search-seeslides.png)

* If there are duplicates, this makes it easy to pick the best and most updated version. 
* Add slides to your slide tray by clicking the green plus. 

![Add slides from search](img/search-addslides.png)

You can also use [advanced search](shufflrr-advanced-search.md) for more precise search options. 

Perform more searches to get more slides. 

## 3. Publish

Once your content is organized, it's time to publish to your full user group so that the whole company can use the curated material appropriately to inform, connect, and sell.

Publishing has three steps: adding users to the system, adding users to groups, and giving groups permissions to folders. 

### Users

To add a user, click the "Admin" icon and "Users" tab. Click the green "Add User" button. 
![Adding users](img/shufflrr-add-user.png)

### Groups

Go to the groups tab & add a group 
![Creating a group](img/presentations-permissions-groups.png)

Once you have saved your group, you are automatically taken to the group settings. Check off the roles you would like for this group overall (not in reference to a folder yet). 

![Adding roles to a group](img/presentations-permissions-grouproles.png)

Click the "Add Users" tab and add users.

![Adding people to a group](img/presentations-permissions-groups-addusers.png)

### Permissions
You can use permissions to organize who can see what content, and who can use it, and use it in which ways. 

To set up permissions, click the down-arrow on the right side of the folder name. Select "Permissions."

![Giving permissions to a folder](img/presentations-permissions.png) 

In the first box, type the name of the group who should have permissions to this folder. 

![Search for the group you want to give permissions to](img/presentations-permissions-modal.png)

Select View Only, Read, Write, or Full Control.
* _View Only_ means users can only view & present from this folder, but cannot copy, download, or change slides in this folder. 
* _Read_ means users can see slides from this folder, and pull slides from here to make new presentations, but cannot change slides in this folder. 
* _Write_  means users can edit the slides and presentations in this folder. 
* _Full Control_ means users can take any action on material in the folder, as well as updating permissions on the folder itself. 

![Select read, write, and share as appropriate](img/presentations-permissions-modal2.png)

>**Pro tip!** 
>
> For Read or Write, select whether this group can share presentations or not (Full Control always allows sharing; View Only never allows sharing). Sharing a presentation gives the user the ability to send it to anyone internal or external in a read-only, slide-show-viewer format.
