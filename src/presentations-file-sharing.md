## Why share a file? 
* Provide information to clients 
* Provide information to sales prospects
* Ask a colleague for their opinion

> **Pro tip:**
>
> If you want to submit the file for approval, use [workflow tags](admin-workflow.md), not shares! 

## Steps

There are many ways to share a deck. For one, click the down arrow next to the file name in the left navigation to see a share option.

You can see whether your past shares were opened or downloaded as well as take action on past shares - see the [user profile shares tab](admin-users.md#share-reporting) information.
