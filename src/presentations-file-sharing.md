# File Sharing

## Why share a file? 
* Ask a colleague for their opinion
* Provide information to clients 
* Provide information to sales prospects

## Steps

* There are many ways to share a deck. For one, click the down arrow next to the file name in the left navigation to see a share option.
* You'll still have an option to pick a different file; if you have the right file, ignore the first field. 
* Enter the email addresses you want to share with & add a message. 
* Select whether to allow downloads and whether to get alerts, & set an expiry if needed.
* The success popup will have a link you can click to see the share. 

> **Pro tip:**
>
> If you want to pass the file to someone for approval, use [workflow tags](admin-tags-workflow.md), not shares!
