# Add permissions on folders

## Why set permissions on folders? 
* Maintain confidentiality: Only people who should see this content can see it.
* Maintain content integrity: Those who should not edit this content won't be able to do so. 
* Simplify searching: If users only have permissions to see into a few folders, their searches won't be cluttered with hundreds (or thousands!) of files irrelevant to them. 

## Steps

### (a) Set up groups 

* #### _Go to the groups tab & add a group_

* #### _Add people to your group_ 
    * Once you have saved your group, you are automatically taken to the group settings 
    * Check off the roles you would like for this group overall (not in reference to a folder yet).

    * Click the "Add Users" tab and add users.

### (b) Give groups permissions 
* Click the down-arrow on the right side of the folder name. Select "Permissions."

* In the first box, type the name of the group who should have permissions to this folder.

* <a name="readOnlyPermissionSetup"></a>Select Read, Write, or Full Control.
    * _Read_ means users can see slides from this folder, and pull slides from here to make new presentations, but cannot change slides in this folder. 
    * _Write_  means users can edit the slides and presentations in this folder. 
* For Read or Write, select whether this group can share presentations or not (Full Control always means sharing is allowed). Sharing a presentation gives the user the ability to send it to anyone internal or external in a read-only, slide-show-viewer format.
