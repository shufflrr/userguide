# Permissions

## Why set permissions on folders? 
* Maintain confidentiality: Only people who should see this content can see it.
* Maintain content integrity: Those who should not edit this content won't be able to do so. 
* Simplify searching: If users only have permissions to see into a few folders, their searches won't be cluttered with hundreds (or thousands!) of files irrelevant to them. 

## Steps

### (a) Set up groups 

* #### _Go to the groups tab_ 
    * Click the gear labeled "Admin" in the top bar with the logo. 
    * Click the "Groups" tab. 

* #### _Add a group_ 
    * Click "Add group"
    * Enter a group name & save - for example, Marketing Northeast 
    * This takes you to that group's settings. 
    * Check off the roles you would like for this group overall (not in reference to a folder yet). 
    * Click the "Add Users" tab and add users.

### (b) Give groups permissions 
* Click the down-arrow on the right side of the folder name. Select "Permissions." 
* In the first box, type the name of the group who should have permissions to this folder. 
* <a name="readOnlyPermissionSetup"></a>Select Read, Write, or Full Control.
    * _Read_ means users can see slides from this folder, and pull slides from here to make new presentations, but cannot change slides in this folder. 
    * _Write_  means users can edit the slides and presentations in this folder. 
* For Read or Write, select whether this group can share presentations or not (Full Control always means sharing is allowed). Sharing a presentation gives the user the ability to send it to anyone internal or external in a read-only, slide-show-viewer format.
