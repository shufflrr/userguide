A **Presentation Management System (PMS)** is software used to orchestrate the creation, modification, and discovery of slides.

**Slides** are the basic building block of a Presentation Management ecosystem, containing data, facts, figures, images, videos, and files on a visualized surface. The content in a slide is queryable via integrated search. Slides exist as PowerPoint-compatible XML (PPTX) or HTML5 for optimal availability.

**Presentations** are sequences of slides organized to further one or more core ideas.

**Builders** are free slide sequences that can be composed to form unique presentations.

**Folders** are containers for presentations and all other media file types, including PDFs, images, and videos.

**Reports** are data visualizations for presentation and slide usage metrics. Reports are a fundamental element of Presentation Management for optimizing sales and marketing workflows.

**Reactions** are communication metadata wherein users can react to and comment on content internally.

**Branding** is a slide enforcement layer ensuring users comply with font, color, and templating guidelines specific to your company.

**Tags** are slide metadata for the organization of slides between presentations into their own conceptual grouping (e.g. "data", "2021", "sales", etc.).
